# Chatbot: Development and Deployment


In recent years, the surge in popularity of chatbots has transformed the landscape of technology and business. These intelligent conversational agents have mastered the art of mimicking human language, prompting widespread adoption across various industries. From e-commerce giants to healthcare providers, organizations are harnessing the power of chatbots to enhance customer interactions and drive business growth.

This project focuses on the development and deployment of a Customer Support Chatbot. Leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques, the chatbot was trained using Deep Learning algorithms and deployed using Flask.




## Requirements
1- TensorFlow    
2- Flask

## Execution
To run the chatbot, begin by executing the chatbot-training.py file to train the model. This will generate a file named chatbotmodel.h5, which serves as the model for the Flask REST API. After training the model, run flask-dep.py to initialize and start the chatbot.

To enhance the chatbot's capabilities, modify the intents.json file to include additional terms and vocabulary. Then, retrain the model to incorporate these changes.
